<h2 id="-engineering-experience">👩🏼‍💻 INTEREST RESEARCHES</h2>

<p><strong>Online Portfolio Selection (AI Finance)</strong></p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Portfolio selection aims to optimize the wealth distribution of a set of assets and choose the best portfolio to maximize returns and minimize risks. It is very interesting to use math- ematical models to find the optimal algorithm, and to find the best performing portfolio in multiple portfolios.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Recent related research on statistical analysis are about using the uncertain parameters in the classic Cox-Ross-Rubinstein (CRR) model to calculate the fair price range of European- Asian options. Methods include statistical data analysis to determine the range of model pa- rameters and calculation of the optimal investment portfolio to find the upper and lower price limits.</p>


<p><strong>Data Analysis</strong> <br /></p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;With a certain understanding of government affairs data and financial data, I have ana- lyzed and processed hundreds of millions of data. The intention is to find the optimal strategy to combine the researched algorithm for data analyzing and processing. Analyze and process various types of big data, combine theory with practice, study data mining, data analysis, data privacy protection and other big data core technologies, aim to create actual value.</p>

<p><strong>Machine learning (Algorithm)</strong> <br /></p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;AI financial part is included in Machine learning, which involves a wider range, requires more mathematical knowledge, and a deeper understanding of algorithms. Until now, I have a preliminary understanding of the basic machine learning and common analysis strategies, know Linear Regression algorithms, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression algorithms, K-Means, Gradient Descent and other basic algorithms, and going to study further research in Deep Learning.</p>
